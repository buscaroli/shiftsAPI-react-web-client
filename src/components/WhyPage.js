          You might be wondering what made me develop this app in the first
          place, after all there are probably already a bazillion app that do
          similar things. Well, if I have to be honest, you are probably correct
          and humanity didn't need a new 'keep track of your life' app...
          however I needed it! You see, I have been learning to code for a while
          now, and I needed a bigger challenge and at the same time I wanted to
          make something that at least I could use and that wouldn't go straight
          to the 'forgot-me-already-git-repo-cemetery' (yes that's a real
          thing).
